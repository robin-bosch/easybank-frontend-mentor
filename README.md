## My process

### Challenges

- Getting the hero images to fit on all screen sizes
- Making sure the text sizes are correct according to the design


### What I learned

- Working with SVG and changing their color in inline SVG
- Working with overflowing images

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

All was written in plain HTML, CSS and JS. No framework was used in this one. JS is used just for the mobile navigation menu.

## Validation and Testing

### HTML Validation

HTML validation was done with the [W3 HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) and came back with no warnings.

### CSS Validation

CSS validation was done with the [W3 CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and came back with warnings regarding the variables which are currently not checked.

### Accessibility Testing

Accessibility was checked with the browser extension of the [WAVE validator](https://wave.webaim.org/) and came back with contrast errors for the text which is given from the design.

### Device Testing

The website was tested on the following devices:

- Windows 11 PC (Screen resolution: 2560x1440)
- Xiaomi MI 9 with Android 11 (Screen resolution: 1080x2280)
- Xiaomi Pad 6 with Android 12 (Screen resolution: 1800x2880)

Other screen resolutions were tested in the browser with dev tools from 2560x1440 down to 320x568.

### Useful resources

Two helpful reference guides I use: 
- [Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
- [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
